The full story behind this odd result has to do with the limitations of floating-point
hardware and its inability to exactly represent some values in a limited number of bits.
Because computer architecture is well beyond this book’s scope, though, we’ll finesse
this by saying that all of the digits in the first output are really there in your computer’s
floating-point hardware—it’s just that you’re not accustomed to seeing them. In fact,
this is really just a display issue—the interactive prompt’s automatic result echo shows
more digits than the print statement. If you don’t want to see all the digits, use print ;
as the sidebar “str and repr Display Formats” on page 116 will explain, you’ll get a
user-friendly display.
Note, however, that not all values have so many digits to display:
